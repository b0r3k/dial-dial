  abstract   = {Contextualized embeddings, which capture appropriate word meaning depending on context, have recently been proposed. We evaluate two methods for precomputing such embeddings, BERT and Flair, on four Czech text processing tasks: part-of-speech (POS) tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing and named entity recognition (NER). The ﬁrst three tasks, POS tagging, lemmatization and dependency parsing, are evaluated on two corpora: the Prague Dependency Treebank 3.5 and the Universal Dependencies 2.3. The named entity recognition (NER) is evaluated on the Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.1 and 2.0. We report state-of-the-art results for the above mentioned tasks and corpora.},

We report benchmark results of various models supported by our toolkit on GSC and our own freely available wake word detection dataset, built from MCV. One of our models is deployed in Firefox Voice, a plugin enabling speech interactivity for the Firefox web browser. Howl represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully productionized, open-source wake word detection toolkit with a web browser deployment target. Our codebase is at howl.ai.},

  abstract   = {In a spoken dialog system, dialog state tracking refers to the task of correctly inferring the state of the conversation – such as the user’s goal – given all of the dialog history up to that turn. Dialog state tracking is crucial to the success of a dialog system, yet until recently there were no common resources, hampering progress. The Dialog State Tracking Challenge series of 3 tasks introduced the ﬁrst shared testbed and evaluation metrics for dialog state tracking, and has underpinned three key advances in dialog state tracking: the move from generative to discriminative models; the adoption of discriminative sequential techniques; and the incorporation of the speech recognition results directly into the dialog state tracker. This paper reviews this research area, covering both the challenge tasks themselves and summarizing the work they have enabled.},
